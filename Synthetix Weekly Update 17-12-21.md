## Governance

### Spartan Council and Core Contributor Committee
	
- SNXWeave published an election-special Spartan Council panel podcast [here](https://anchor.fm/snxweave/episodes/Spartan-Council-Panel---December-Election-Special-e1bm38g)
  - Voting opened December 16th, 2021 and will close one week from this day.

- The [LUSD wrappr](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-156/) parameters have been updated. Now, the wrappr cap has increased to 75 million sUSD, and the minting fee has been increased to 10 basis points 
	
- [Liquidation Mechanism upgrade](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-302/) will be implemented once [Debt Shares](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-185/) is ready
  
  - There have been some concerns about liquidity on L2 that led to this decision
  
  - "Debt Shares is actually ready, but unfortunately won’t be audited until early next year, as the auditors are extremely backed up this month. And since the liquidation mechanism SIP has already been presented, it can pretty much be implemented as soon as Debt Shares is ready. IF the audit can somehow be accelerated, that would allow for the new liquidation mechanism to potentially be rolled out before the end of the year."[^1]

### AmbassadorsDAO

- December 8th, 2021 [dHedge](https://www.dhedge.org/) was the guest in another [Spartan City Hall](https://anchor.fm/synthetix/episodes/SD040---Spartan-City-Hall-5---dHEDGE-e1bdkn0)
  - dHEDGE is a non-custodial decentralized asset management platform that links investors and fund managers together in a decentralized way to enable efficient fund management
	
  - Cyrus, JakeyBoi, Taminater, and Edson gave a high-level overview of dHEDGE and answered some questions
	
  - "The guests explained that dHEDGE is a little over a year old, and was made possible via Synthetix — being able to trade and hold all of the synths available on L1. Their launch last October brought a lot of managers and investors, who were keen on being able to utilize the zero-slippage feature, which was especially attractive for larger trades."[^2]

  - In response to high gas usage, they created a Layer 1.5 solution which is a way to do computations off chain, so the entry and exit into dHEDGE pools was significantly cheaper and gas fees were brought down to Uniswap prices

  - Gas fees continued to climb, which led to dHedge v2
	
- Starting Decemeber 21st, Optimism is hosting a [dHedge trading competition](https://dhedge.ghost.io/trading-comp/) with $100,000 in prizes
