# <p align="Center"> How to post your Weekly Update on Github 📢



**1.** Before opening Github, make sure your document is formatted correctly to paste into Github smoothly.
- If you’ve never used Github before, that’s okay! Follow these steps carefully and don’t be afraid to ask questions along the way 👍

**2.** To get started, go to https://github.com/boardroom-inc and select protocol-info

**3.** Select the Protocols folder, select the DAO you are covering, select the Resources folder, select Weekly Updates

**4.** Select Add File and then Create New File

**5.** In the Name your file… field , place the title of your Weekly Update with the date at the end of the title as “dd-mm-yy.md” For example “Compound Weekly Update 17-09-21.md”

**6.** Weekly Updates on the DAOs need to be in the form of the layouts presented here or here. Feel free to ask questions about formatting in the Discord. 

**7.** Reference this website for assistance formatting your writing in Github
 
- https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

- Again, don’t be afraid to ask questions in the Discord 🤝

**8.** Pay close attention to these next steps and to naming the Project Name, and inserting the right URL and Name on the “img src” line.

### <p align="Center"> This is how the beginning of your post should look in Github when you get started

\<p align="center">
  \<a href="http://app.boardroom.info/[Project CNAME]">
    \<img src="[DAO Image URL]" alt="[DAO NAME]" width="400" />
  \</a>
  \<h1 align="center">[Project Name] Weekly Update</h1>
  \<p align="center">
    \[Month] [Day], [Year]
  \<br />
\</p>
\</p>

### <p align="Center"> And after you insert the proper information...

\<p align="center">
  \<a href="http://app.boardroom.info/">
    \<img src="[(https://www.lexpunk.army/#top)]" alt="LeXpunK Builder Defense DAO" width="450" />
  \</a>
  \<h1 align="center"> LeXpunK Weekly Update</h1>
  \<p align="center">
    \September 16, 2021
  \<br />
  \<a href="http://app.boardroom.info/LeXpunK"><\strong>View in the Portal»\</strong></a>
  \<br />
 \</p>
\</p>

**9.** To create a heading, add 1 to 6 # symbols before your heading text. 

The number of #’s you use will determine the size of the heading. Remember to use a space after you use the first # for the change to be recognized.

Examples:

- \# The largest heading
- \## The second largest heading
- \###### The smallest heading
