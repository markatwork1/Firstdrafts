## Discord Announcements

[October 19th Recap Blog](https://snxweave.medium.com/snxweave-weekly-recap-7c758cf5a717)

[On Spotify]()

- **Reminder that a New Voting Guide** was released for new Synthetix Community Members [here](https://medium.com/@akng105/a-guide-to-synthetix-voting-for-new-community-members-fa57d929b2ce)

- [Sargas](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-sargas-release/) was officially deployed on Mainnet OVM, meaning [shorting](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-135/) is now available on L2

- [Atomic Exchange Function SIP](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-120/)

## Governance

- [SIP - 182](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-182/) almost completed but will likely be released after regenesis.

- [SIP - 80](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-80/) for Futures is progressing well. The goal is to have it ready after the regenesis.	

- [SIP - 187](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-187/) further presented progress
> "During his presentation, Jackson explained that the partial updates in the debt cache aren’t being updated properly when minting and burning sUSD. However now, with SIP-187, when minting and burning sUSD, the debt cash and the total debt value of the system are updated right away, and don’t require a debt snapshot to happen first. This fix will be applied on L1 and L2, and actually slightly reduces the minting and burning costs in the process. This SIP is currently being voted on."[^1]
	
- Moving forward there will be clearer differentiation between Synthetix as an infrastructure provider and Kwenta as a dApp developer
  - Working on blog post to detail the specifics of this change 
	
- For Spartan Council updates, Kain suggested creating a project management tool for everyone to use.
- Kain will be putting this together and will serve to more clearly iterate and details their goals and expectations for the epoch.
	

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
- [SIP - 172](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-172/) aims to simplify meta-governance processes of the Synthetix Governance System.
  - redefines the different types of governing bodies within Synthetix, including the difference between the roles and responsibilities of a Council versus a Committee
  - If approved, each of these governing bodies will now fall under the umbrella term of “Synthetix DAOs.” 
	
**New Names of Synthetix Councils**
	
1. Spartan Council
2. Treasury Council
3. Grants Council
4. Ambassador Council
5. Core Contributor Committee
6. Risk Committee
	

- The Risk Committee, proposed by [SIP - 186](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-186/) would consist of five members who would be responsible for analysis of risk within the Synthetix Protocol, carrying out the risk analysis to be introduced in the SIP life-cycle, and providing risk analysis summaries for the Spartan Council to take into consideration when debating and voting on SIPs
  - Currently discussing a possible trial period for the Committee as well as reducing the number of committee members and adjusting the time period epochs for committee positions 

## Summary
	
	
	
	
	
	
- Per [SIP - 186](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-186/) have the Risk committee members selected by the other governing bodies, rather than selected from within them.
