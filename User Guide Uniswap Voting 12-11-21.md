### <p align="center"> *User Guide for Uniswap from Mark Priddy - November 12th 2021*


## Introduction to Uniswap Voting

This guide will describe how to vote using the Uniswap platform and inform users how Uniswap governance works.
- [Official Uniswap Governance discussion forum](https://gov.uniswap.org/)

**Stay Informed**
  
- Follow Official Research Documentation at [docs.uniswap.org](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/advanced-topics/research)

## The Voting Process
  
- If a [proposal is currently live](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote), it will say "Active" next to the title. 
  - Clicking the proposal will show all the necessary information, documentation, and discussion needed for voters to make an informed decision.
  
- *Refer to Delegating your UNI below*
  
- If you have successfully self delegated and there is an active proposal, you are ready to vote in Uniswap Governance.
  
- To cast your vote, navigate to the proposals page and click on an [active proposal](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/9).
  
- After reviewing the attached details and deciding your opinion, choose “Vote For”, or “Vote Against”.
  
- Once chosen, a window will pop up allowing you to execute the vote.
  
- When you click to cast your vote, metamask will prompt you asking to confirm the transaction.
  - Click “submit”, and check that the transaction has been confirmed  

- Once your transaction has been confirmed, your vote has been cast and you have participated in Uniswap Governance.

## Delegating your UNI

**UNI is a tradable cryptocurrency asset and functions like most other standard ERC-20 tokens**
  
- In order for Uniswap tokens to be used as a vote, the owner must first go through the delegation process. 

- Delegating UNI binds the voting power of your tokens to an address so it may be used to vote. 
  - This address could be yourself or a trusted party who you trust to vote in the best interest of Uniswap Community.

*Preface: A significant amount of UNI is needed to delegate a vote or vote yourself.*
  
- A democratic consensus, in a process called “quorum”, is determined by the percentage of UNI tokens in favor of, or against, a proposal. 
  - 1% of all UNI must be cast in favor to submit a proposal, and 4% in order to pass a vote.

- To delegate UNI tokens and enact their voting power [visit the Uniswap voting dashboard](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote) and click the button that says “Unlock Voting”.
  
- Once you select "Unlock Voting", you should see a screen that gives you the option to self delegate, or add a delegate address. 
  - You may delegate your UNI voting power to your own address by clicking “Self Delegate”.
 
- When you select “Self Delegate”, a transaction will appear in Metamask. 

- If this doesn’t appear, double check that Metamask is connected to [app.uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap), turn off any popup blockers, restart your browser, and try again. 

- Click confirm, and once the transaction has processed, you will see that the voting dashboard homepage has changed to show the number of votes you have, and “Delegated to: Self”.  

- Users who wish to delegate their voting power to another party, choose “Add Delegate” and enter the ethereum address of your chosen voting party.  
  
- **An important note:** for UNI to be used in a vote it must be delegated before both the voting period and the preceding proposal period. 
  - This means if you want your vote to count, you must delegate it in anticipation of any proposal you may be interested in.
  
- If you are unsure of how best to vote and are interested in delegating your UNI voting power to another party, you can visit the [Delegation Pitch section of the governance forum](https://gov.uniswap.org/c/delegation-pitch/6). 
  - Parties participating in Uniswap Governance pitch their platform and voting agenda for users to read and discuss.
  
  
### Uniswap Voting Review
  
**Users need these to participate in Uniswap voting:**

- Uniswap Tokens
- Ethereum tokens for transaction costs
- Access to Metamask  
  
## Understanding the Governance Process
  - Council meetings, proposals, discussion
  
- The governance process begins in the [Governance Forum](https://gov.uniswap.org/)

- Once a given proposal has made it through the proposal process and is ready for voting, it will appear in the [Uniswap voting dashboard](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote) - where you can view all current and former Uniswap proposals.
 
- Once a proposal has reached the voting stage it represents real, executable code which will alter the functionality of Uniswap Governance or anything under its jurisdiction. 
 
- Due diligence should be taken when you participate in Governance discussions, making your voice heard whether or not you support the idea being presented.
