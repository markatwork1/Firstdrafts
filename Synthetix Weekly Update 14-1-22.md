- Matt went over how the Across model allows users to not have to go through AMMs or trading fees since there is a base rate that is based on how long it will take to perform the migration or transaction.

- **Three Roles on Across:**
  
  - 1. Liquidity providers (LPs), who provide liquidity to Layer 1 in a lending pool
  
  - 2. End users who want to send funds
  
  - 3. **The Relayers:**

  - Slow relayers pretty much go and inform the pool about a request, then it must wait about 2 hours for disputers to check that there is actually an L2 deposit that corresponds to this relay.
  
  - Fast relayers, on the other hand, will verify it themselves and instantly front the money to a user, and the pool will pay THEM back instead. This allows these transfers to be effectively instant, and if the fast relayer is wrong, then they lose out on the money, not the pool (meaning the liquidity providers are not exposed to the risk).

    - This is a nice UX feature and also allows these fast transfers to happen without having to trust a centralized party
  
## Summary

- No news from the Spartan Council as of January 12th, 2022
  
- NFT project is still coming along with a NFT marketplace on both Mainnet and Optimism in the works
  
- Across Bridge/ Protocol spoke with Synthetix community and explained their crypto asset bridging service
 

## Additional Research

- Hosted a Town Hall January 5th, 2022 with AcrossProtocol, a fast bridging solution for Optimism
	
  - [Across](https://across.to/) enables users to instantly withdraw tokens from Optimistic Ethereum for an upfront fee
