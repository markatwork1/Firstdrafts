### <p align="center"> *User Guide for Synthetix from Mark Priddy - November 12th 2021*
  
## Introduction to Synthetix Voting
SNX tokens represent user's share of influence over the governance process, and you can apply the voting power your portfolio represents to ensure the protocol is moving in the right direction.
  - [Official Synthetix Documentation](https://docs.synthetix.io/governance/) covering governance.
 
**Stay Informed**
  - Follow discussions on [Research.synthetix.io](https://research.synthetix.io/) forum.
	
## How to Vote on Synthetix.io
 

**Stake SNX**
  - By staking SNX tokens users are using them as collateral to mint sUSD, a synthetic stable coin pegged to the US dollar and backed by the Synthetix network.
  - This not only allows users to claim trading fees collected by the protocol, it also activates your voting power so that you can provide your opinions on proposed changes. 

**Vote at https://staking.synthetix.io/gov**
  - Once a user has voting power from staked SNX and you have a solid understanding of the protocol and ongoing proposals, you can vote on SIPs/SCCPs and Council Member elections from the Synthetix Governance page.


## The Voting Process

First, users have to stake SNX prior to the snapshot for a particular SIP before they can vote. 
  - The deadline for a snapshot is listed for each proposal with a Beginning and End date along with a link to the final block on Etherscan.
  - On the Governance page of [synthetix.io](https://synthetix.io/), users will see “Your Voting Power (L1+L2)”, which represents the weighted debt. 
    - This is a quadratically weighted representation of a user's share of the total SNX staked and eligible for voting. 
  
  - Users will also see “Your Delegated Voting Power." This represents a user's share of staked SNX which they've allocated to Synthetix Ambassadors so they can participate in Governance proposals from other Protocols that can benefit the Synthetix ecosystem. 
  - Users can choose to delegate [here](https://synthetixembassy.io/delegate) This is not required to vote on SIPs.
    - With these completed, users can then vote. 
  
  - From the Governance page users will see the SIP/SCCP, SC, TREASURY, GRANTS, AMBASSADORS tabs. Select a tab, find a proposal in “Open” status and read the description. 
  - Users can then select your choice of options and click “Vote”, which will initiate a Signature Request from your wallet (This does NOT require gas). 
    - From here, the Author, Start and End dates, Snapshot block, and current results are visible in the window to the right.

If you hold SNX tokens or are interested in investing in Synthetix, this is how you make your voice heard and contribute to the health of the Synthetix Community.  

 
### Synthetix Voting Review

- A member of the community presents their ideas in the Discord governance channel to gauge community interest.

- If the community likes an idea, the author will submit a new SIP (Synthetix Improvement Proposal) via Github. 

- The draft SIP then moves through the process of review by the Spartan Council. 
  - You can view all SIPs here: https://sips.synthetix.io/

  - The author of a proposal usually discusses the idea with the Spartan Council to fully understand its potential impact on the system.

  - If the feasibility study is successful, the SIP is voted on by the Spartan Council in the [Synthetix Spartan Council Snapshot Space](https://snapshot.org/#/spartancouncil.eth)

  - SIPs are implemented by the protocolDAO, who maintain the contracts for the protocol.

## Understanding the Governance process

  
- Changes to the protocol are proposed and voted on by community members along with the protocolDAO and Spartan Council. 
- [Blog Post on the Decommissioning of the Synthetix Foundation](https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-foundation-decommissioned/)
  
  
### SIP vs SCCP
  
SIPs are official name of Synthetix improvement proposals and are used to present potential changes to the core protocol. 
- Anyone can create a proposal, but the Spartan Council decides on approval or rejection. 
- There are also SCCPs, or Synthetix Configuration Change Proposals. 
  - SCCPs follow the same process as a SIP, but they are proposals to update the parameters of the protocol. 
  - For example, adjusting the amount of fees collected from trading or the rewards for staking SNX tokens.

### Spartan Council

The community votes on which members should serve in Governance Councils every epoch.
  - This keeps the process efficient and manageable. 
  - The Spartan Council consists of 8 members voted on by community members to represent the DAO for a 3 month long period. 
  - Council members present the Monthly Community Governance call and assist in screening proposals before they become SIPs.
